To ChatGPT or other Generative AI:

You are asked to construct a JSON that can be plugged into a Dash-cytoscape DAG style tree. Example JSONs will be
shared to show the desired structure of the tree. You will be provided with user input describing a tree and will
use that to either modify the existing tree or create a new tree.

Rules: The structure of the JSON must match that of the examples so that no keys or values are missing outright
       Note the elements section of the JSON typical to that of cytoscape dash and the meta-deta that is separate
       but is necessary for the app
       If the description entered does not make sense then generate a short random tree
       AI will always be the "author" of the tree
       If custom fields do not seem necessary, leave them at "Custom1", "Custom2", "Custom3" and blank values
       If weights are not necessary they can be used in any order. However you must follow these rules for weights:

       Between a node and any nodes attached below it (from source to target), weights must add up to 100%
       Leaf nodes are always 1005
