# Tree maker, likely to be renamed
The goal of this app is primarily to create a tool surrounding DAG trees to be used with other projects
Might as well make it look nice in the process and there should be potential to make it open source
If it works out I might submit it at https://community.plotly.com/t/share-your-app-explore-page-october-2024/87674/2?_gl=1*18de7h*_gcl_au*MTM2MzQwNjY2My4xNzI2NTMyMTc4*_ga*Njg0MDE4MzgzLjE3MTc5NDcwMTc.*_ga_6G7EE0JNSC*MTczMDMxODc2OS42MC4wLjE3MzAzMTg3NjkuNjAuMC4w

As of 10/30/24 . . . home page is a bit put together along with the tree and tree information
